📊 Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
Welcome to the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer! 🎉 This project is a Python-based GUI application that demonstrates sorting algorithms with stunning animations. Designed for beginners and enthusiasts alike, this tool helps visualize how sorting works step-by-step. 🚀

✨ Features
Visualize Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, and Selection Sort in action! 🪄
Customize the number of bars to sort. 🧱
Dynamic animations for swapping bars. 🔄
Easy-to-use graphical interface powered by Tkinter. 🎨
See the smallest and largest bars highlighted in real-time. 🟥⬛
🛠️ Tech Stack
Python 🐍
Tkinter (for GUI development) 🎨
Random Module (to generate bar heights) 🎲
🎮 How to Run the Project?
1️⃣ Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed. If not, download Python.

2️⃣ Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sorting-algorithm-visualizer.git
cd sorting-algorithm-visualizer
3️⃣ Install Required Modules
This project uses only the built-in Python libraries, so no additional installations are required! ✅

4️⃣ Run the Application
Run the Python script to start the visualizer:

bash
Copy code
python sorting_visualizer.py
5️⃣ Interact with the App
Enter the number of bars you want to sort (e.g., 50).
Click on the sorting algorithm buttons (Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, or Selection Sort) to see the sorting process in action.
Shuffle the bars anytime with the Shuffle button! 🎲
🚀 How It Works
Generate Bars: Randomly sized bars are displayed on the canvas.
Choose Algorithm: Select a sorting algorithm to see it animate in real-time.
Highlight Key Elements:
Smallest bar: 🔴 (Red)
Largest bar: ⚫️ (Black)
Animation: Bars swap positions as the sorting algorithm processes the data.
