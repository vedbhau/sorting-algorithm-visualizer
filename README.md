# 📊 Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

Welcome to the **Sorting Algorithm Visualizer**! 🎉  
This Python-based GUI application demonstrates sorting algorithms with stunning animations. Designed for beginners and enthusiasts alike, this tool helps visualize how sorting works step-by-step. 🚀

---

## ✨ Features

- Visualize **Insertion Sort**, **Bubble Sort**, and **Selection Sort** in action! 🪄  
- Customize the number of bars to sort. 🧱  
- Dynamic animations for swapping bars. 🔄  
- Easy-to-use graphical interface powered by **Tkinter**. 🎨  
- See the smallest and largest bars highlighted in real-time:
  - 🔴 Smallest bar
  - ⚫️ Largest bar

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python** 🐍  
- **Tkinter** (for GUI development) 🎨  
- **Random Module** (to generate bar heights) 🎲

## 🎮 How to Run the Project?

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites
- Ensure Python is installed on your system. If not, [download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  

### 2️⃣ Clone the Repository
Run the following commands in your terminal:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vedbhau/sorting-algorithm-visualizer.git
cd sorting-algorithm-visualizer

3️⃣ Install Required Modules
This project uses only built-in Python libraries, so no additional installations are required! ✅
4️⃣ Run the Application
Run the Python script to start the visualizer:
bash

bash
Copy code
python sorting_visualizer.py
5️⃣ Interact with the App
Enter the number of bars you want to sort (e.g., 50).
Click on a sorting algorithm button (Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, or Selection Sort) to see the sorting process in action.
Shuffle the bars anytime with the Shuffle button! 🎲

```

🚀 How It Works
Generate Bars: Randomly sized bars are displayed on the canvas.
Choose Algorithm: Select a sorting algorithm to see it animate in real-time.
Highlight Key Elements:
🔴 Smallest bar
⚫️ Largest bar
Animation: Bars swap positions as the sorting algorithm processes the data.

### 🛡️ Acknowledgements
Inspired by various sorting algorithm visualizers online.
Developed by Ved Malegaonkar. 🌟

### 🧩 Future Enhancements
Add more sorting algorithms like Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort. 🔢
Include a pause and resume feature for animations. ⏸️⏯️
Add a step-by-step explanation for each sorting algorithm. 📚


### Key Updates:  
- The **bash block** for commands stops after the "Run the Application" step.  
- Plain text (`plaintext`) is used for the steps under **Point 5** so they render correctly in GitHub without being part of the code block.  

This format ensures clarity and proper syntax rendering in your GitHub README. 😊
